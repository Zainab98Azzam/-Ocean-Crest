The Ocean Crest Hotels Cancellation Analytics Competition is a data science challenge focused on predicting hotel booking cancellations. Participants analyze booking data to identify patterns and factors influencing cancellations, aiming to develop predictive models that can assist hotels in managing reservations more effectively.

Key Aspects of the Competition:

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled.

Dataset: Participants are provided with a dataset containing various features related to hotel bookings, such as booking dates, customer demographics, and reservation details.

Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on their predictive accuracy, with metrics like the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) commonly used to assess performance.

Impact: Accurate predictions can help hotels optimize room occupancy, reduce revenue loss from cancellations, and improve overall operational efficiency.
